The Royal Game of Ur is a racing board game. Both players are competing to run their pieces across the board before their oppoenent. The basic turn is as follows:

1. Roll the dice
2. Make a valid move.
  a) If you can make no valid moves or you rolled a 0, your turn is over.
3. If you landed on a green tile, go again (go to step 1)
4. Your turn is over, and your opponent begins from step 1.

Each "dice" has 4 sides: 2 are marked black, 2 are marked white. Each roll consists of rolling 4 of these dice simultaneously. The number of white spots is added up and becomes your roll. This means it is possible to roll a 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

## Valid Move

Only one piece can occupy a tile at any given time.
You can move onto a tile occupied by your opponent's piece, as long as it is not on a green tile: their piece is returned to their reserve.
You can not move onto a tile occupied by your own pieces.

### Entering the board

Rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4 allows you to place a piece on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th tile on the board from your reserve, respectively.

### Exiting the board

You must roll exactly 1 more than the number of tiles remaining between your piece and the end of the board. There are 14 total tiles on each players track: this means you need a roll such that your piece lands exactly on the "fifteenth tile".

# Instructions

Red Player goes first.

1. Click the Roll button. The value you rolled is displayed. Any pieces that have a valid move are now "highlighted" with a ring appearing around them.
2. Hover over one of the highlighted pieces. An empty circle will appear on the board representing where that piece would move to.
3. Click to move the selected piece to the indicated tile.
4. If you landed on a green tile, go back to step 1. Otherwise, it is now the other player's turn.
